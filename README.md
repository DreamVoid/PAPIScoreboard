<<<<<<< HEAD
基于 https://github.com/SunnyYT/PAPIScoreboard 修改而成，并使用MIT协议开源

Essentially is a plugin for spigot/bukkit servers which utilises the scoreboard feature and also uses another plugin called PlaceholderAPI and lets you use the placeholderapi api to change and customise what the scoreboard says.
